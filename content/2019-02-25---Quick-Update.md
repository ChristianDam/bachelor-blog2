description: "A brief update on the project since the last post"
---

Since the last post we have spend a lot of time on defining the exact project that we want to do. We created a 1 side paper, where we described the project more in details. After our trip to Tokyo, we have worked on the related work section of the report. We have found some interesting articles within the areas of social acceptance, gestures and alternative authentication methods.  

## Problem definition 

We want research how bodily engagement in authentication can alter the users perception of authentication and security. Furthermore, we want to research which gestures or motions are social acceptable and at the same time secure in a cryptographic manner. 

##Motivation

The human physical body is gradually becoming the standard for authenticating, e.g. through face recognition, fingerprint and voice recognition. A lot of research has looked into how we ensure that biometrics are cryptographically secure, but there has not been a lot of research on how the user experience the use of biometrics. Furthermore, many industry standard biometrics, like finger print and face recognition, does not require active user engagement. We find it interesting to examine how active user engagement in the authentication interaction impacts the user's perception of authentication and security.
