Secure authentication is often a compromise between level of security and user experiences.
This project explores new approaches to secure authentication placing user experiences at the forefront. This involves investigating context-aware authentication, new input modalities for authentication including wearables, accessories, in-air gestures, as well as granularity in security.



The project is made in collaboration with Danske Bank.
