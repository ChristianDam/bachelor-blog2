We met with three employees from Danske Bank at their IT office in Brabrand. We had a good talk about the background for the project and how it was relevant for Danske Bank as a cooperation. The main goal with the meeting was to get a better common understanding of what we want make a project about. One of the conerns Danske Bank had was that it should be a project which was relevant for them and not too far out in the future for being implemented. Therefor they suggested us to see if we could use existing technologies such as smartphones, watches etc. to develop our concept with. With that said they were still very open-minded for us to create our own components as long we had a realistic time frame in mind. 



We represented our initial ideas for what we want to develop, some of the ideas we represented was: 

- In air-signatures using Leap Motion 
- Physical SSL Authentication 
- Context/use authentication - can recognise the user on their context and use 



We agreed on getting in touch after we have had our first meeting with Marianne, so we can present them with the project we want to do. Then Josefine from Danske Bank will help us find a contact person within the expertice that fit our project.
